# EQ Display
Vanilla usage of the SparkFun Spectrum Shield, this simply reads an audio
input, and displays the audio bands produced by the shield.

## Components
* M4 Airlift Lite (NOTE: any Arduino R3 compat M0/M4: Airlift only for future
  features).
* Adafruit DotStar Matrix 16x16
* SparkFun Spectrum Shield

## Construction
Construction was very minimal. I opted to have the board itself power the LED
matrix at 5% brightness (which was plenty for where it was being displayed).
Too much brighter and I would have used an external power source, but keeping
it simple I used prototyping jumper cables to wire everything up.
